# A World With Zero Carbon Emissions, For Real

The science is clear. The continued rise in global temperatures will cause widespread economic and humanitarian damage, and disrupt complex environmental systems around the world. The only way to prevent this is to completely eliminate carbon emissions. Not to offset emissions, or recapture them, but actually eliminate them entirely.

We are Real Zero, an organization which believes that the only way to mitigate the effects of human-caused climate change is to thoroughly and rapidly reduce human emissions of greenhouse gases. The latest evidence is on our side, but the latest policies have some catching up to do.

While the widespread commitments to Net Zero are an impressive statement of intent from the global community, the latest evidence suggests that offsets, carbon credits, and carbon capture are all ineffective at actually mitigating harm. Their chief utility, it seems, is allowing governments and corporations to continue to emit while preserving their reputations. 

Our mission is to change attitudes towards emissions and promote policies which eliminate them entirely. Backed by the latest climate science, we develop rigorous models and policy roadmaps to help both governments and corporate entities achieve Real Zero.
